# Workflow Registry

Central inventory of all active n8n workflows. **Claude maintains this file.** Update it whenever a workflow is created, versioned, activated, deactivated, or deleted.

> **IDs listed below are production IDs** (`flows.caiacdigital.com`). Staging IDs differ — the JSON file contains the staging ID. Verify any ID via `n8n_list_workflows` or `n8n_get_workflow` before relying on it.

---

## How to Read This Registry

- **Status:** `active` = deployed and live | `staging` = exists in staging only | `pending-deactivate` = superseded, still running | `deactivated` = off
- **Calls:** sub-workflows this workflow invokes via Execute Workflow node
- **Called by:** workflows that invoke this one
- **File:** corresponding JSON in `workflows/` (prod export)

## Auth Layer

| Workflow | Prod ID | File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[Utility] Full Auth v2.0.0` | `XWbmBI9NYdwK80eg` | `full-auth-v2.0.0.json` | active | Called by all protected webhooks to validate JWT + return features |
| `CAIAC Auth - Signin v2.0.0` | `E9aHZeoUdtpguTaD` | `auth-signin-v2.0.0.json` | active | — |
| `CAIAC Auth - Refresh v2.0.0` | `ZCCKeovM47Z3UNNb` | `auth-refresh-v2.0.0.json` | active | — |
| `CAIAC Auth - Signout v1.0.0` | `Q0i9qGzfEanRayou` | `auth-signout-v1.0.0.json` | active | — |
| `CAIAC Auth - Change Password v1.0.0` | `qKqrfdGqY21WxkYw` | `auth-change-password-v1.0.0.json` | active | — |

## Intake Layer

| Workflow | Prod ID | File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[Intake] CAIAC Lead Capture v2.0.0` | `FXGmlYKi5Wy1QKX6` | `intake-lead-capture-v2.0.0.json` | active | Current prod version. Pending update to v2.1.0 — see `.claude/plans/lead-data-architecture.md` |
| `CAIAC Demo - Lead Capture v1.2.0` | `Z6hV4ALmmPL4IdAr` | `lead-capture-v1.2.0.json` | deactivated | Inactive in prod — remove from n8n when confirmed safe |
| `[Intake] Lead Capture v1.0.0` | `5eVBapje2TWpeMvj` | — | deactivated | Old version, inactive in prod |

**v2.1.0 changes (planned):** writes `intake_data JSONB` to `caiac.leads`; sheet append is dynamic from `field_map`; wires `CRM Create Lead` (new interface: client_id + lead_id) after DB insert (non-fatal on failure); drops `crm_type`/`source_id` column writes.

**Calls:** `[Utility] Score Lead v1.0.0`, `[Utility] CRM Create Lead v1.0.0`, `[Utility] Send Email via Resend`

## Maintenance Rules (for Claude)

1. **On workflow create** — add a row to the correct table above. Leave Prod ID as `—` until deployed to prod.
2. **On prod deploy** — fill in the Prod ID column.
3. **On version bump** — add the new row, move old row to `pending-deactivate`, set File to the new JSON filename.
4. **On deactivation** — change status to `deactivated`; remove row after the next session confirms it's gone from n8n.
5. **Missing `—` IDs** — fill them in when you have MCP access via `n8n_list_workflows`.
